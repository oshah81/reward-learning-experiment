# Computational Models Underlying Reward-based Motor Learning

## Intro ##

This repository contains the supplementary materials for my Goldsmiths MSc study on the cognitive neuroscience of motor learning. It is a github fork of the main repository,
hosted in [pavlovia](https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/oshah001/reward-learning-experiment).

See my presentation on the program website [Coconeuro](https://coconeuro.com/).

## Description of the folders ##

### Root ###

The root folder contains the code for the associated [github site](https://oshah81.github.io/reward-learning-experiment/), which hosts the tutorial.

[Qualtrics.js](https://github.com/oshah81/reward-learning-experiment/blob/main/qualtrics.js) is the code that was used for the decision making task on [Qualtrics](https://goldpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_78HXnfuhPrk5KPc),
it is an amalgamated version of the code in the final [tutorial](https://oshah81.github.io/reward-learning-experiment/Tutorial5.html).

### analysis ###

Contains the MATLAB files used for analysis of the data. [See the readme in that folder](https://github.com/oshah81/reward-learning-experiment/tree/main/analysis).

### data ###

Contains the data as used in the MSc thesis.

### js ###

Contains the suport Javascript used in the tutorial and the github site.

### supplementary materials ###

Contains additional supplementary materials mentioned in the thesis.

### OldIgnore ###

Contains older versions of the codebase. They are here for archival purposes.
